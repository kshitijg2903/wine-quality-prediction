This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict wine quality using physicochemical features. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was preprocessed using standardization and SMOTE to address class imbalance. Both machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and deep learning architectures (e.g., shallow and deep neural networks with regularization techniques like dropout) were explored. Weights & Biases (WandB) was used for hyperparameter tuning and visualization. Results indicate that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting performed best among machine learning models, while deep learning models benefited from dropout but struggled with batch normalization on this small dataset.
